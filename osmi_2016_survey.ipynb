    "In 2016, OSMI, or Open Sourcing Mental Illness, conducted a survey in 2016, in which 1433 participants were asked 63 questions in order to evaluate attitudes toward mental health and the frequency of mental health disorders in the tech industry. The data set has one row for each participants' response and columns representing questions, with some notable ones including: \n",
    "- Does your employer offer resources to learn more about mental health concerns and options for seeking help?\n",
    "- Has your employer ever formally discussed mental health (for example, as part of a wellness campaign or other official communication)?\n",
    "- Is your anonymity protected if you choose to take advantage of mental health or substance abuse treatment resources provided by your employer?\n",
