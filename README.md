This was the first group project I ever got to work on in my data analytics journey. It was a final project for my MS course at Santa Clara University - Data Analytics with Python. Our task was to team up with 3-4 classmates, find any public dataset online that seemed interesting, and uncover 3 major findings for it. My awesome partners were [Aaron Huang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-huang-scu/), [Aditi Bagepalli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditibagepalli/), and [Brian Beams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brimism/). After a few days of contemplating over which dataset we were going to use (scrolling through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)), Aaron found the OSMI 2016 Survey dataset, which we all mutually agreed was the most interesting and informative.

Our project primarily utilizes Python packages such as Pandas, seaborn for visualization, and sklearn for machine learning. Some highlights of the project were the data cleaning (funnily enough), the regression model, and the decision tree. Check out the Jupyter notebook for further analysis.

Overall, I was able to implement a lot of techniques/concepts I learned from class in the project and learned a lot!
